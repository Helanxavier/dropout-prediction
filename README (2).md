## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure all required packages are installed.
3. Run the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook ML2.ipynb
```

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes visualizations to help understand:
- Correlation between features
- Model performance (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, etc.)
- Feature importance (for tree-based models)

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Train-test split validation**
- **Cross-validation (where applicable)**

## 📌 Notes

- The dataset used is assumed to be a classification dataset (e.g., binary or multi-class labels).
- All preprocessing and training steps are done within the notebook, making it a self-contained project.
